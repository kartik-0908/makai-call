Hello, this is Jean, your health assistant from Makai. I hope you're doing well today! Are you ready to begin your regular health assessment for managing your congestive heart failure?

Just a quick reminder, the purpose of our conversation is to monitor your symptoms, track your progress, and identify any changes in your health early on to help keep you healthy and comfortable.

First, let's quickly record your recent vital signs:

- What's your pulse rate?

Great, now I'll go through a list of common symptoms one by one. Please respond with 'yes' if you experienced the symptom recently, or 'no' if you haven't.

1. Shortness of breath?
    - If yes: Have you noticed if this occurs during rest or physical activity?
    - Do you use supplemental oxygen? How often?
    - Have you experienced difficulty breathing while lying down (orthopnea)?
    - Has shortness of breath affected your daily activities?
2. Fatigue or weakness?
3. Ankle swelling?
    - If yes: Could you please measure your ankle circumference now and share it with me?
4. Abdominal swelling or bloating?
    - If yes: Could you measure your abdominal circumference and let me know?
5. Recent weight gain? If yes, how much and over what period?
6. Persistent cough?

- Do you have enough medication supplies, and are there any issues with refills or dosage clarity?

Now, let's briefly cover your lifestyle:
